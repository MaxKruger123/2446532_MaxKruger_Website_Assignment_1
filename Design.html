        <article class="StyleGuide e-content">
            <h1>Style Guide</h1>
            <p lass="p-summary">The overall aesthetic of my website was dark and minimalistic. I decided to go for a dark theme because it is much easier on the eyes and contrasts well with white. The backgrounds used in my website are all black or grey
                whilst the text is either white or gold. The white text stands out and contrasts the backgrounds which makes all of my content much more readible. The gold text is saved for buttons or navigation so that the user knows where the are at all times. 
                Gold also helps my website convey a sharp "tuxedo" and sleek feeling so that the website feels very professional. The Font's vary according to their needs. 
                <br><br>Since my website is minimalist but also themed around space I felt that the home page font called "Entanglement" is a great way to convey the complexities of space and to keep within my theme but also gives a sleek simple feeling since the text is surrounded with negative space. 
                Following this is the layout of my website. There is not an overloading amount of panels or content on the main pages. They also use a display of block to keep is simple which ties in with the idea of the website.
