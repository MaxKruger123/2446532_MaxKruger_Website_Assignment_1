            <p class="p-summary">This page was inspired by a minimalistic black blog page that I stumbled upon. It has an interesting format where the latest blog is at the top of the page and the rest are below it and are smaller but users can still interacct with them.</p>

            <p class="p-summary">This is another simple page that contains the actual blog post with an image at the top that represents whatever the blog is about. There is also a return button that returns the user to the blogs page.</p>

            <h6 id="The Interactive Data Visualization">Planning for Interactive data visualization</h6>
            <p>Due to previous feedback, I have wanted to attempt a bubble chart but I also wanted to make it interactive. I want to attempt to use force simulations for pure practice but make the bubble chart interactive so that when the user hovers over each bubble it displays a tool tip on the information about each comet.</p>

            <h6 id="The Static Data Visualization">Changed static data visualization 1</h6>

            <p>I have changed my previous first data visualization to become a bar graph istead of having 2 scatter plots, this helped me explore differrent options and taught me how to create bar charts</p>

        <article class="StyleGuide e-content">
            <h5>Style Guide</h1>
            <p class="p-summary">The overall aesthetic of my website was dark and minimalistic. I decided to go for a dark theme because it is much easier on the eyes and contrasts well with white. The backgrounds used in my website are all black or grey
                whilst the text is either white or gold. The white text stands out and contrasts the backgrounds which makes all of my content much more readible. The gold text is saved for buttons or navigation so that the user knows where the are at all times. 
                Gold also helps my website convey a sharp "tuxedo" and sleek feeling so that the website feels very professional. The Font's vary according to their needs. 
                <br><br>Since my website is minimalist but also themed around space I felt that the home page font called "Entanglement" is a great way to convey the complexities of space and to keep within my theme but also gives a sleek simple feeling since the text is surrounded with negative space. 
                Following this is the layout of my website. There is not an overloading amount of panels or content on the main pages. They also use a display of block to keep is simple which ties in with the idea of the website.
            </p> <br> <br>

            <p class="p-summary">There have been changes since the last iteration of my website. Firstly, the website can sometimes feel endless without a footer in place, So I decided to create a button that when clicked returns the user to the top of the page. the button also uses a green border to emphasise a pop of colour making it more outstanding than other regular text. Secondly, for less of a bland website i have used more images 
                that have different colours but still match the theme of space or data visualization, this creates a more interesting website rather than just constanty having a black background. The overall aestethic of my website has not changed, I have still decided to keep simplicity at the top of my focus. In the future however I would like to change my headers font since it casn sometimes feel unreadible, especially if it is a users first time visiting the site.
                My data visualizations page also used a lot of red on the visualizations themselves, this again constrasts my black backgrounds well and is a pop of colour. Finally I have made sure that my p tags do not stretch across the entire screen, this makes my text and paragraphs far more readible because users do not have to strain their eyes aross the screen.
            </p><br> <br>

            <p class="p-summary">For Assignment 3 I have made more changes to my website specififcally in my data visualization section. As previously mentioned I have changed my first data visualization to a bar graph which helped vary my visualizations and provided a nice ccolour pop due to the bars being yellow. I also played around with force simulations in my interactive visualization. When the user hovers over a bubble it displays a tool tip with the appropriate data being displayed. Lasly I have played with my design fonts to make them more readible, however I might change my header font in the future. Although I believe it fits the websites aethetic very well.
                Lastly I would like to present a minimalistic inspiration for my website.

            <p class="p-summary">For the exam assignmnet we were tasked with creating another Data-driven artwork, I quite enjoyed creating my mars collage so decided to
                create something that is somewhat similar but functions differently. I decided to create a space image gallery. This Gallery uses the APOD NASA API whitch fetches
                the astronomy picture of the day. I used this to create a scrollable gallery. The gallery has the current days image in the middle with the next image on the right side 
                and the previous days image on the left side. There are arrowsd that the user can click on in order to swap between these images. Furthermore, underneath of the gallery, 
                the date that the current image was taken is displayed and the description of the image provided by NASA's API is also displayed. These dynamically change with the current image
                that is in the middle of the gallery.
