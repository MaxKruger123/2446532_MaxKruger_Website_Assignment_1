        <article class="StyleGuide e-content">
            <h5>Style Guide</h1>
            <p class="p-summary">The overall aesthetic of my website was dark and minimalistic. I decided to go for a dark theme because it is much easier on the eyes and contrasts well with white. The backgrounds used in my website are all black or grey
                whilst the text is either white or gold. The white text stands out and contrasts the backgrounds which makes all of my content much more readible. The gold text is saved for buttons or navigation so that the user knows where the are at all times. 
                Gold also helps my website convey a sharp "tuxedo" and sleek feeling so that the website feels very professional. The Font's vary according to their needs. 
                <br><br>Since my website is minimalist but also themed around space I felt that the home page font called "Entanglement" is a great way to convey the complexities of space and to keep within my theme but also gives a sleek simple feeling since the text is surrounded with negative space. 
                Following this is the layout of my website. There is not an overloading amount of panels or content on the main pages. They also use a display of block to keep is simple which ties in with the idea of the website.
            </p> <br> <br>

            <p class="p-summary">There have been changes since the last iteration of my website. Firstly, the website can sometimes feel endless without a footer in place, So I decided to create a button that when clicked returns the user to the top of the page. the button also uses a green border to emphasise a pop of colour making it more outstanding than other regular text. Secondly, for less of a bland website i have used more images 
                that have different colours but still match the theme of space or data visualization, this creates a more interesting website rather than just constanty having a black background. The overall aestethic of my website has not changed, I have still decided to keep simplicity at the top of my focus. In the future however I would like to change my headers font since it casn sometimes feel unreadible, especially if it is a users first time visiting the site.
                My data visualizations page also used a lot of red on the visualizations themselves, this again constrasts my black backgrounds well and is a pop of colour. Finally I have made sure that my p tags do not stretch across the entire screen, this makes my text and paragraphs far more readible because users do not have to strain their eyes aross the screen.
