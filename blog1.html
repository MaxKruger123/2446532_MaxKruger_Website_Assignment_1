        <h2 id="heading">Blog Post 1 - Understanding Data Visualization through an example</h2>
        <p id="intext">After reading Chapter 2 of Li’s book ‘Embodying Data’, I had a better grasp of what Data Visualization is but still wanted a specific real-world example of how it is used. I searched the web for examples until I found one that really surprised me. Many researchers have defined Data Visualization with complex definitions but I found that Bikaki’s definition is best suited for those who do not yet understand d+ata visualization. This essay covers Chapter 2 of Li’s book where he first looks at what Data Visualization is. Second, the different aspects of Data Visualization. Third, the difference between data and information. Lastly, my findings with a specific example of how Netflix successfully uses Data Visualization. <br><br>
            In Li’s book ‘Embodying Data’, Chapter 2, he considers many definitions of Data Visualization. However, I found his final mentioned definition to be the most fitting. Bikakis defines Data Visualization as “the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format” (Li, 2020). Most of the definitions Li refers to include the link between data and computer technology in order to transform the data into some sort of visual form. Nonetheless, I feel that Bikakis’s definition is simple enough to understand even if an individual has no prior knowledge of Data Visualization. The other definitions provided are more complex and suited to groups with a prior understanding of Data Visualization because some words require a higher cognitive ability. This is seen in words such as “quantified data”. Furthermore, Bikakis states that Data Visualization provides users with an “intuitive means” to analyze and explore data which then allows users to identify patterns and correlations, and supports “sense-making activities” (Li, 2020). <br><br>
            Li says that in modern times, Data Visualization consists of four different aspects. The first is real-time interaction. At first, I did not understand what this meant, however, upon further research I learned that real-time data visualization lets the pictorial data representation update in real-time, enabling stakeholders to make decisions based on actual data rather than a feeling or intuition. Personally, I see this in South Africa with the national elections. In real time, voters vote for the next president and on News24 there is a visual representation of the live vote numbers in the different provinces. This allows the government to make a decision on actual data. The second aspect mentioned by Li is on-the-fly visualizations which is the ability to present your data whenever you want (on-the-fly). The third aspect is visual scalability which refers to the capability of visualization tools to effectively display large datasets (Ludichart, The power of real-time data visualization)—finally, user assistance and personalization. I think different people prefer different visuals to portray data, for example, I may prefer a pie chart but my girlfriend may prefer bar graphs. Changing the visual presentations to what suits a user the best may lead to faster understanding and easier pattern recognition. <br><br>
            Moreover, data visualization can be divided into two types of visualization forms. Information visualization refers to more abstract data that is being visually presented and Scientific visualization uses scientific data. Both of these forms include how to visually present data and the transformation of data into information. The difference between data and information is something that I have had to study since high school IT. To my knowledge data is unprocessed information without any meaning. An example of data would be a bunch of numbers in an Excel sheet at random positions. They are just numbers and do not mean anything. However, if we were to assign each number a name next to it with a heading at the very top of the Excel page that says “Age of participants,” then we have processed data which is then referred to as information since we as the user can now understand that the numbers have a meaning. 
            Following the clarification of the difference between data and information, Li speaks on the forms of Traditional Data Visualization. Traditional Data Visualization is defined in Li’s article as data visualization that focuses on “communication for understanding” data rather than other approaches(Li, 2020). The different forms of Traditional Data Visualization present different visual effects which may aid in finding problems or patterns in data. 
            Although, after reading this text, I wanted to dig deeper and find a real-world example of how data visualization has aided companies. I thought to myself that I can see data visualization as more than just helping companies make decisions based on patterns. Because data visualization aids in the process of understanding data to make a decision I thought that it would also be great for advertising to the public. There are still many modern ads that are filled with text that we as consumers are far too lazy to read, but with data visualization, consumers can process a message or data presentation in a few seconds. Netflix had a campaign run for its new show ‘Narcos’ in which they smartly used Data Visualization in order to create advertisements for the show. Here is an example of some of the ads: <br><br>

            <br><br>These ads helped Netflix gain over 100 000 engagements on their website and therefore helped create more income. Li states that as an emerging field, data visualization is considered as “information design” and its goal is to organize and present information to a given audience (Li, 2020). Netflix accomplishes this by using its creative ideas combined with scientific visualization in order for the audience to quickly obtain comprehension and insight into the data and show. This proves that data visualization can be used to persuade others to find interest in a product or service through advertising. 
            In conclusion, Data Visualization is visually representing data as information through a pictorial or graphical format. These visual presentations are processed data that has meaning and therefor becomes information. Netflix successfully uses Data Visualization in order to create more profit through advertising.
