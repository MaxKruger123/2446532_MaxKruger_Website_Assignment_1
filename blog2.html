            Preliminary style guide:

The overall aesthetic of my website was dark and minimalistic. I decided to go for a dark theme because it is much easier on the eyes and contrasts well with white. The backgrounds used in my website are all black or grey whilst the text is either white or gold. The white text stands out and contrasts the backgrounds which makes all of my content much more readible. The gold text is saved for buttons or navigation so that the user knows where the are at all times. Gold also helps my website convey a sharp "tuxedo" and sleek feeling so that the website feels very professional. The Font's vary according to their needs. <br><br>

Since my website is minimalist but also themed around space I felt that the home page font called "Entanglement" is a great way to convey the complexities of space and to keep within my theme but also gives a sleek simple feeling since the text is surrounded with negative space. Following this is the layout of my website. There is not an overloading amount of panels or content on the main pages. They also use a display of block to keep is simple which ties in with the idea of the website.<br><br>

Analysis of UI Guide & Checklist:
I wanted my website to be simplistic rather than cluttered, this not only played well into the aesthetic I was looking for but also created clarity. The design is not too focused on the aesthetic so that the website is still able to function properly and doesn't confuse users. I like to think my website is consistent through its colors, fonts, and headings. Certain fonts on my pages are exclusively used for headings. This creates familiarity for users so that they know what is a heading and what is plain text. The structures used on my site also indicate consistency, using tags such as h1 and h2 properly combined with fonts and font sizes makes it easy for users to differentiate between what is important first. This also aids with the user flow.<br><br>

Speaking of familiarity, one of the most important aspects of a site in terms of navigation is the header. My header stays consistent throughout my different pages and it uses the same effects throughout. The colour gold also helps users understand where they are on the website. This is probably one of the most common conventions used on every site and is essential for users to understand and navigate a website properly. The Top Nav bar is always visible which is a great way for users to be able to quickly switch pages whenever they want.<br><br>

There is also a lot of negative space used throughout the site which creates focus on certain aspects of the design that is important. For instance, the homepage uses a lot of black negative space which focuses the user on the image in the middle of the page to an astronaut and the name of my website (Space Intel). This used the first principle of design effectively.<br><br>

HomePage WireFrame:


To emphasize more the colours that I used, the main colours used throughout my website are white and black. This is simple yet effective because it creates so many opportunities for contrast. This combined with negative space helps create focus for the users.<br><br>

HomePage:


If we take a look at my Blog Page where the user can select to view different blogs, we see the implementation of Useful Feedback. If users hover over a blog post, the mouse changes to a pointer, indicating that this can be clicked on to go to the actual blog post. Not only this but there is a small transition in the background colour when a user hovers over it. Users may not notice this but subconsciously but it definitely adds to the idea of making design invisible but still effective. The same goes for when users hover over any button on the top nav bar, The button transitions into a bigger size and changes colour to indicate that it is being selected. <br><br>






The blog page also uses negative space to create a focus on the first blog post which is in the middle of the page. The font used on the site fits the space theme well and gives a sharp and trusted feeling to the user but is also still readable and legible.<br><br>

The majority of the site uses an Asymmetrical balance where elements of the design offset each other but still look and feel balanced. With the exception of the homepage which uses a radial balance where the focus is the exact middle of the screen with the name of my website arranged around the middle of the page.<br><br>

Lastly with regards to UI, the entire website has great flexibility that works across multiple different platforms. Images, text, the top nav bar, and other aspects all change with regard to the user's screen resolution whilst keeping everything readable and accessible. <br><br>
