        <h2 id="Heading">Blog 3 - Interaction in Data Visualization</h2>
        <p id="Intext" class="p-summary">
            This Blog Post speaks about the interesting concept of interaction within data visualization. I will be referring to a work written by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin. The abstract of the text gives a great overview of the introduction that explains that the concept of interaction within data visualization is very confusing. The author's argument is that the confusion is caused by the lack of a consensual definition for interaction. In the work, the authors used a methodology that involved both the visualization community and visualization experts, this way they would gain both perspectives and can then find similarities between them in order to create a definition. The methodology also broadens the scope of interaction by including information visualization, visual analytics and scientific visualization. The author's wider goals for creating this definition were to spur novel and help with “bolder interaction design practices” within visualizations (Dimara & Perin, 2019). For word count reasons I will not be providing extreme details of the authors methodology, however, briefly put, expert visualization researchers were given a questionnaire that they chose to fill out. Once the authors had gotten back all of the responses they found many papers that the experts had recommended on defining interaction. The author states that these papers revealed “mandatory components of interaction. (Dimara & Perin, 2019)” These are external and internal entities, and external and internal actions. The two most important entities were the user (a human) and the data. External actions include the dialogue between the user and the visualization system. Finally, Internal actions involve the “reasoning/analytical process” (Dimara & Perin, 2019). 

            <br><br>To me this was a very insightful work, as it deepens my understanding of what interaction is in the context of visualization. As previously mentioned, Interaction is a very confusing concept, not because the word itself is very confusing but rather because many of us feel as if we understand what interaction is in a broader concept.  However, we do not fully understand what it means in a more specific concept such as data visualization. I agree with the work in that defining the word under this context could broaden our scope for interaction and assist in interaction design practices. 
            
            <br><br> Furthermore, the work breaks down the properties of what interaction is which is very helpful in fully understanding what interaction is on a deeper level. The work states that the first property is granularity which has multiple levels. Firstly, on a micro-level, we use mouse clicks to interact. Secondly, on a macro-level, we hypothesize and find patterns or solutions in data visualizations. Lastly, there are levels between these that include filtering or sorting data and information to make more sense out of it. I would think of these as the base level of interaction in the context of data visualization. The next property of interaction is a bit more complex and involves continuous and discrete interactions. Continuous interactions involve the user's actions that occur over time such as dragging the mouse in order to create a lasso selection. Discrete interaction is associated with an “action or reaction” that occurs in a distinct manner (e.g checkbox filtering). Finally, the last property of interaction includes Direct vs Indirect interactions. Direct interactions involve objects of interest that are represented rapidly, incrementally and reversibly, and also allow for usage with “minimal knowledge”. Indirect interaction might include command line interfaces which require a deep knowledge in order to execute (Dimara & Perin, 2019). 
            
            <br><br>This provides a great frame for what interaction is but still does not define interaction as a whole. The work combines the views of experts and the HCI to create a compact definition for Interaction as the “interplay” between humans and a “data interface” that involves “data-related” intent (Dimara & Perin, 2019).
            
            <br><br>The last bit of the work that I will be referring to before giving my own voice is the limitations of the work. The work does not claim that their definition captures all perspectives of interaction such as those with the absence of intent. Another limitation is that the work does not include the perspectives of user engagement which is an important aspect of interaction with data visualizations. Interaction techniques were also left out due to the lack of suggested papers by experts. 
            
            <br><br>I find this work very interesting because it surprised me with how little I know. Originally before reading this text, if someone were to ask me what interaction was I would probably give them an answer that isn't too specific but captures the overall idea of the word. This text has deepened my understanding of what interaction is and how we can better develop semantics on the subject. I think that with many more modern technological fields that are still being created, there is a lack of definition and semantics on many subjects. Defining and digging deeper on these subjects such as Interaction in the context of data visualization is important because it lifts the entire field and develops everyone's understanding of it. This work is a great example of this because I can definitely see myself working in web creation and data visualizations, and this text has provided me with key information regarding what interaction really is. It has also made me more curious about the limitations of this work such as interaction techniques which were left out in this text and user engagement as well.
            
            In conclusion, this text is great for anyone interested in data visualization and is a must-know for anyone seeing themselves in data visualization in the future. The work as a whole deepened my understanding and I am sure even experienced experts in the field could benefit from the work.
