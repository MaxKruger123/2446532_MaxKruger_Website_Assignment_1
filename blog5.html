            This essay discusses the relationship between Data Visualizations and Data-driven art. It touches upon how both of these tools use representational strategies in different ways in order to achieve different goals. Firstly, through a careful breakdown of what data visualization and data-driven art is and its goals, we can then decipher the ways in which these tools are similar and/or are different. Secondly, through the defining of representation, and exploring the different strategies used by Data Visualizations and Data-driven artworks, we can find the relationships between data visualization and data-driven visualization. Lastly, by the consideration of an extra layer of interactivity, which further strengthens the representational strategies on these tools we can further understand the role of representation in these artworks.

<br><br>Data Visualization is viewed by the majority as a tool used for “exploration” and  “hypothesis formation” (Viegas et al., 2007). The tool is focused on forming a “connection” between data and computer technology into a visual form. This visual form provides us with a much more fluid and straightforward perspective on a data set which then allows for us to pick up on certain patterns and trends within the data set, that without the data visualization would be near impossible to notice. Although Data Visualizations are seen mainly in use within the sciences field such as computer science and are used for further research and to “support scientific analysis,” within the last decade there has been a rather different use of these tools (Li, 2020). Art based on data has been featured in many different museums throughout the world, such as the  Salavon’s ‘The class of 1988’ which at first glance appears to be blurred graduation photos of students from 1988 but is in fact an artwork based off of data. This piece was created by taking the mean averaging colour of each photo, pixel by pixel. The artwork investigates a rite of passage, which in this case, is high-school graduation. But what constitutes this as an artwork? Viegas and Wattenberg claim that it is the intent that molds this piece as an artwork. Artworks such as this that are driven by data are what has produced a relatively new idea called “Data-driven artwork”. Data-driven artwork and Data Visualizations are not to be mixed, although they both share similarities, they also hold key differences. Both types of tools, art and visualizations, are based on a data set. Many Data-driven artworks also use “sophisticated visualization techniques” but are used in a very different style in order to make it unique (Viegas et al., 2007). One of the key differences between the two is that artworks using data have an artistic intent behind them. This means that they are similar to other types of art in that they explore a theme or invoke an emotional reaction out of people who view them. Another key difference is that the artists forcefully present a point of view. Viegas describes this as the artworks gaining power from committing various “sins” in terms of visual analytics (Viegas et al., 2007). This step in the seemingly opposite direction from traditional artworks that enforce more rules and adhere to them, makes these artworks very different and unique compared to traditional data visualizations. Both of these also use different ways of representation. The most common methods of representation used in traditional Data Visualizations are line graphs, bar graphs, scatter plots and other basic to understand methods that do not blur the data or force the viewer to engage in critical thinking. On the other hand, Data-driven artworks such as ‘The class of 1988’ use complex distortions and sometimes abstract ones in order to create meaning. Salavon used a “blur” in his art piece which forces the user to not focus on individual images of the students but rather to force the point of view of the collective -  to point to the rite of passage which is high school graduation, in which many of us must go through.

<br><br>Representation is concerned with the creation of meaning. According to Marcel Danesi, representation can be described as the process of building “X” which then pulls attention toward something conceptual, “Y” (Kidd, 2015). A basic example of this can be a data visualization of a company’s revenue growth. The built data visualization itself would be a bar graph displaying each year's revenue over the last 5 years with each bar growing larger and larger as each year passes (Kidd, 2015). The graph itself is “X” as it was built. The “Y” in this context would be the concept that this graph pulls attention toward, which is the growth of the company’s revenue over the last 5 years (Kidd, 2015). Data-driven artforms use different representational strategies. Data-driven artists know that the value of their art rests on the fact that they understand art's ability to express a certain point of view. An artist's audience may agree or disagree with the point of view, however, this evokes an emotional reaction to the work and causes the audience to think differently and test their own perspectives. Data-driven artists use distortions (I use this word to describe any sort of rule break against traditional data visualizations) to create their meaning and perspective. On the other hand, traditional data visualizations and analytics attempt to keep distortions to a minimum since it may intrude into “dispassionate analysis” (Viegas et al., 2007). Viegas and Wattenberg make an interesting argument by suggesting that traditional visualizations may be “misguided” in the attempt to minimize distortions (Viegas et al., 2007). Instead they investigate the possibility that data visualization forms including Data-driven Art can be used to not only analyze but to persuade viewers. I believe this is a core representational strategy that differs between data driven and data visualization. Art uses the ability to persuade its users and audience to a point of view and sometimes challenges it through representation. This is something that regular Data Visualizations lack that could be implemented to further strengthen its representational strategy.

<br><br>Over the past decade artists have become more and more interested in technology and its use within the arts field. They explore the possibilities of technology within their work. This is what has led up to artists using data sets in order to drive their artwork. Janssens states that techno artwork “reaches out” to individuals in a direct way and draws upon their imaginative and emotional capacities (Roeser, 2016). This link to an emotional reaction is what makes artworks persuasive and also gives them power. Techno artworks have the power to influence society. Janssens suggests that art also aids in our ethical and political thinking. Furthermore, Data-driven art sometimes (depending on the artwork) enables another layer of representation through interactivity. Interactivity can have many forms but involves input from a viewer that then leads to an output. This process allows viewers to engage with the art piece in a more “personal way”, overall, allowing for the audience to gain a greater appreciation for the creative process (Viegas et al., 2007). Interactivity within art also creates an immersive experience for the viewer. It has the possibility to break the barriers between the artist and audience and allows for a dialogue between the two to occur. Many Data visualizations and Data-driven art allow for interactivity in different ways and is a powerful representational strategy. 

<br><br>In conclusion, both Data-Visualization and Data-driven artworks are based on data sets and both share the usage of “sophisticated visualization techniques” but are used in very different ways. However, Data-driven is different in that the intent behind the creation of the artwork is present and different from the intent of traditional Data-Visualizations. Another key difference in these tools is that Data-driven artwork forcefully presents a point of view through breaking conventional Data analytical rules, thus making them unique. Data-driven artists use distortions in order to create their artwork's meaning and evoke emotion in the audience. Artworks also use influence and persuasive techniques in order to strengthen their representation. Techno Artworks such as Data-driven art also sometimes use interactivity. This involves the input from an audience that turns out an output. Furthermore, interactivity creates a more immersive experience for a viewer and allows for a dialogue between the artists. Overall, interactivity allows viewers to gain a greater appreciation for the creative process.
